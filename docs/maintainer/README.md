# Maintainer continuity and recovery

This directory exists so future development can resume from repository/GitHub truth without access to any previous ChatGPT conversation.

It is intentionally separate from the public product README. Do not turn this directory into a running manager diary, chat archive, or duplicate Issue tracker.

## Start here when resuming development

Use the following source-of-truth order:

1. [`../../MASTER-SPEC.md`](../../MASTER-SPEC.md) — durable project purpose, architecture boundaries, non-goals, compatibility rules, and success model.
2. Current product docs under [`docs/`](../) — user-facing installation, behavior, Ability surface, integrations, security, troubleshooting, and development/testing.
3. Source and tests on the current target branch — exact implementation behavior.
4. GitHub Issues and pull requests — active work, unresolved dependencies, decisions, and integration state.
5. GitHub Actions — validation tied to the exact relevant commit.
6. Git tags and GitHub Releases — published release state and artifacts.
7. [`reference/v0.1-pre-release/`](./reference/v0.1-pre-release/) — deeper design/reference material from the original v0.1 development phase when current sources are insufficient.

A future Master should not reconstruct live status from old reference documents. Issue numbers, pre-release gates, and sequencing statements inside the preserved snapshot describe the project at that historical point. Current GitHub state wins for mutable facts.

## Current durable documentation

| Topic | Current source |
| --- | --- |
| Project-level intent and architectural constraints | [`MASTER-SPEC.md`](../../MASTER-SPEC.md) |
| Product overview and normal use | [`README.md`](../../README.md) |
| Installation / ChatGPT connection | [`INSTALLATION.md`](../INSTALLATION.md) |
| User workflows | [`USER-GUIDE.md`](../USER-GUIDE.md) |
| Current Ability families | [`ABILITIES.md`](../ABILITIES.md) |
| Optional providers | [`INTEGRATIONS.md`](../INTEGRATIONS.md) |
| Security model | [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) |
| Current architecture overview | [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Troubleshooting | [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) |
| Development, validation, and release process | [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](../DEVELOPMENT.md) |
| Published change history | [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) and GitHub Releases |

## Preserved v0.1 reference set

The v0.1.1 public-documentation cleanup replaced or removed several detailed documents. Their exact pre-cleanup contents and original relative layout are preserved under `reference/v0.1-pre-release/` so architectural reasoning, internal links, and detailed contracts are not lost.

Preserved layout:

```text
reference/v0.1-pre-release/
├── MASTER-SPEC.md
└── docs/
    ├── ABILITY-INVENTORY.md
    ├── CORE-ABILITY-SAFETY-BOUNDARIES.md
    ├── INSTALLATION-AND-CONNECTION.md
    ├── OPTIONAL-INTEGRATIONS-AND-ADMIN.md
    ├── PROJECT-WORKSPACE-ARCHITECTURE.md
    ├── RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md
    └── TROUBLESHOOTING.md
```

`MASTER-SPEC.md` is the complete 607-line pre-release Master Specification. The files under the snapshot's `docs/` directory are the exact detailed documents that existed immediately before the public-documentation cleanup.

These snapshots are reference evidence, not current live contracts. When they conflict with current code, current durable docs, active GitHub Issues/PRs, CI, or release state, use the current authoritative source.

## Documentation maintenance rule

When future development changes durable product behavior or architecture:

- update the nearest current authoritative document;
- update `MASTER-SPEC.md` only when project-level intent, supported baseline, durable architecture boundaries, non-goals, or completion/success criteria change;
- keep active task state in GitHub Issues/PRs instead of adding status snapshots here;
- preserve important superseded design material under `reference/` only when it contains future-useful rationale that is no longer represented by a stronger current source;
- keep public README content focused on the plugin and normal usage.

## Repository boundary

This repository owns the WordPress Bridge plugin. The companion `ach1992/wp-native-builder` repository is separate. Cross-repository reads may be useful for interface compatibility, but this repository's recovery must remain possible from its own canonical specification, code/docs, and GitHub control plane.

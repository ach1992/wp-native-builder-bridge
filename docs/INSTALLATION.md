# Installation and connection

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.9 or newer.
- Official WordPress MCP Adapter installed and active.
- HTTPS with a publicly reachable REST API for direct ChatGPT connections.
- A WordPress user with the capabilities needed for the intended operations.

## Install the plugin

1. Download `wp-native-builder-bridge.zip` from the latest GitHub release.
2. In WordPress open **Plugins → Add Plugin → Upload Plugin**.
3. Upload the ZIP and activate **WP Native Builder Bridge**.
4. Open **WP Native Builder → Settings**.

The settings screen reports whether the WordPress Abilities API, MCP Adapter, and public HTTPS endpoint are available.

## Connect a ChatGPT Workspace App

The settings screen displays an endpoint in this form:

```text
https://YOUR-SITE.example/wp-json/wp-native-builder/v1/mcp
```

With Developer Mode enabled in the ChatGPT workspace:

1. Open **Workspace settings → Apps**.
2. Create a custom App.
3. Enter the endpoint above.
4. Select OAuth authentication.
5. Run **Scan Tools**.
6. Sign in to WordPress in the browser window.
7. Review the requested connection and select **Authorize ChatGPT**.

The OAuth connection acts as the WordPress user who approved it. Bridge access groups and WordPress capabilities are still checked for every operation.

## OAuth discovery endpoints

The plugin publishes standards-based OAuth metadata at:

```text
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

The MCP endpoint returns an authentication challenge when accessed without a valid Bearer token.

## Configure access

Open **WP Native Builder → Settings** and enable only the groups required by the intended workflow.

A conservative starting point is:

- Site Read: enabled.
- Builder Write: enable when drafts or edits are needed.
- Live Content: leave disabled until publishing is intentionally required.
- Site Configuration: enable only for site/theme configuration work.
- Code & Extensions: enable only for managed snippets or extension lifecycle work.
- Users & Destructive: leave disabled unless the requested operation genuinely requires it.

## Update

Upload the new release ZIP from **Plugins → Add Plugin → Upload Plugin** and use WordPress's replace-existing-plugin flow. Replacing the plugin files does not intentionally clear Bridge settings, OAuth state, or Workspace data.

## Deactivate and uninstall

Deactivation stops Bridge execution but preserves its configuration and Workspace data.

Uninstall removes Bridge settings and activity-log configuration, removes Bridge-owned OAuth metadata, and invalidates outstanding Bridge OAuth artifacts. Persistent Workspace content is intentionally preserved so uninstalling the transport plugin does not silently destroy project state.

If Workspace data is no longer wanted, clear it explicitly from **WP Native Builder** before uninstalling.

## Private or local WordPress sites

A direct ChatGPT Workspace App requires an Internet-reachable HTTPS MCP endpoint. Local-only or private-network installations can still use the underlying WordPress MCP Adapter through another supported client/transport, but they cannot be added to ChatGPT as a direct remote App until the endpoint is reachable from ChatGPT.
